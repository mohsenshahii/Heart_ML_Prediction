    Originally, the dataset comes from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk 
    Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather
    data on the health status of U.S. residents. As the CDC describes: "Established in 1984 
    with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of 
    Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews
    each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the
    world". The most recent dataset (as of February 15, 2022) includes data from 2020. 
    It consists of 401,958 rows and 279 columns. The vast majority of columns are questions
    asked to respondents about their health status, such as "Do you have serious difficulty 
    walking or climbing stairs?" or "Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire
    life? [Note: 5 packs = 100 cigarettes]". In this dataset, I noticed many different 
    factors (questions) that directly or indirectly influence heart disease, so I decided
    to select the most relevant variables from it and do some cleaning so that it would 
    be usable for machine learning projects.
