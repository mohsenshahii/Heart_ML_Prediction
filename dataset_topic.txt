    According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death
    #for people of most races in the US (African Americans, American Indians 
    #and Alaska Natives, and white people). About half of all Americans (47%) have 
    #at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
    #and smoking. Other key indicator include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not
    #getting enough physical activity or drinking too much alcohol. Detecting 
    #and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease 
    #is very important in healthcare. Computational developments, in turn, 
    #allow the application of machine learning methods to detect "patterns" from the data
    #that can predict a patient's condition.
