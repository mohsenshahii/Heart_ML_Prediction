Considering Sleep Time and Mental Health:
                  There should be a negative correlation between Mental 
                  Health and the quantity of occuranse of sleep hours in 
                  the dataset because SleepTime is normaly distributed 
                  and the more normal a value is the more times it is
                  apeared so instead of calculating the correlation between
                  Sleep Time and Mental Health we calculate correlation 
                  between occuranse percentage of a Sleep Time and Mental Health.
